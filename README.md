# HW1-Horiseon-Marketing

## Purpose

This project is to consolidate and consise of original code to meet the client's requirement without changing the appearance of the website.

## Acceptance Criteria & Changes

1. Give a descriptive title to the website
    >Horiseon Marketing Official | Horiseon US
This is indicated that this website is the Horiseon US marketing official webpage.

2. Source code in semantic HTML elements
    >non-semantic elements **dive** and **span**;
    >semantic elements replaced in this project: **section**, **nav**, **main**, and **aside**;
All non-semantic elements are renamed to semantic elements in html. CSS selectors changed inaccordance with the html tags.

3. Elements follow a logical structure
    >selectors in CSS follow the order of semantic elements in html
In original CSS file, the selectors for main section are under the selectors for aside section. These two switched places.

4. Add accessible alt attributes
    >All **alt** attributes added to each image on the website;
Each **alt** attribute is named as the section that the image is located. The **alt** attributes will be available when the images are not properly showing.

5. Heading attributes follow sequential order
    >Heading attributes includes: **h1**, **h2**, **h3**, **h4**, etc;
All the heading tags are renamed to follow the sequestial order.

### Extra Notes

Selectors in CSS file are consolidated and concised to make the code clearer than before. The orginal code has redundant properties under different selectors which can be combined in one section. _This is addressed._

#### Final Review of Website

The following images are the final look of the website. There are two images because I wasn't able to snap the entire website ate once.
